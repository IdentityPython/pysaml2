This is a very simple setup just to check that all your gear are in order.

The setup consists of one IdP and one SP.
The IdP authenticates users by using a htpasswd plugin and gets the identity information
from the ini-plugin.

All this is in the idp/who.ini configuration file, the file used for authentication
is idp/passwd and the ini file is idp/idp_user.ini.

The passwords in passwd in clear text:

roland:friend
ozzie:two
derek:three
ryan:four
ischiro:five

The SP doesn't do anything but show you the information that the IdP sent.

To make it easy, for me :-), both the IdP and the SP uses the same keys.

To run the setup do

./run.sh

and then use your favourit webbrowser to look at "http://localhost:8087/whoami"
