Releasing software
-------------------

When releasing a new version, the following steps should be taken:

1. Make sure all automated tests pass.

2. Make sure the package metadata in ``setup.py`` is up-to-date. You can
   verify the information by re-generating the egg info::

    python setup.py egg_info

   and inspecting ``src/pysaml2.egg-info/PKG-INFO``. You should also make sure
   that the long description renders as valid reStructuredText. You can
   do this by using the ``rst2html.py`` utility from docutils_::

    python setup.py --long-description | rst2html > test.html

   If this will produce warning or errors, PyPI will be unable to render
   the long description nicely. It will treat it as plain text instead.

3. Update the version in the VERSION_ file and report the changes in
   CHANGELOG.md_ and commit the changes.::

    git add CHANGELOG.md
    git add VERSION
    git commit -v -s -m "Release version X.Y.Z"

4. Create a release branch_::

    git branch vX.Y.Z

5. Create a release tag_::

    git tag -a -s vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z"

6. Push these changes to Github::

    git push --follow-tags origin vX.Y.Z
    git push --follow-tags origin vX.Y.Z:vX.Y.Z

7. Create a source and wheel distribution and upload it to PyPI::

    # generate a source and wheel distribution at once
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

    # generated files are under dist/
    ls dist/

    # upload release on test.pypi.org
    twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/pysaml2-X.Y.Z*

    # then, upload release on official pypi.org
    twine upload dist/pysaml2-X.Y.Z*

8. Upload the documentation to PyPI. First you need to generate the html
   version of the documentation::

    cd docs/
    make clean
    make html
    cd _build/html
    zip -r pysaml2-docs.zip *

   Submit the generated pysaml2-docs.zip file.

9. Send an email to the pysaml2 list announcing this release


**Important:** Once released to PyPI or any other public download location,
a released egg may *never* be removed, even if it has proven to be a faulty
release ("brown bag release"). In such a case it should simply be superseded
immediately by a new, improved release.
